Generate skeleton code and architecture from concept or requirements

# Context
Concept, idea, or requirements to implement:
$ARGUMENTS

# Requirements
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Break down the concept into:
   - Core functionality requirements
   - Key components and their responsibilities
   - Data flow and interactions
   - External dependencies
2. **Architecture Design**: Propose structure following:
   - Project patterns from @CLAUDE.md
   - Industry best practices
   - Scalability considerations
   - Maintainability principles
3. **Implementation Options**: Present 2-3 architectural approaches:
   - Simple/MVP approach
   - Scalable/enterprise approach
   - Hybrid/balanced approach
4. **Skeleton Generation**: Create minimal viable structure with:
   - Core interfaces, types, and contracts
   - Essential function signatures with documentation
   - Configuration placeholders and constants
   - Integration points and extension hooks
   - Basic error handling patterns
5. **Development Roadmap**: Outline next steps for full implementation
